COM_EASYJOOMLABACKUP_XML_DESCRIPTION="<strong>Easy Joomla Backup - EJB</strong><br /><br />EJB is a backup component for Joomla! which creates 'old-school' backups without any frills. All files and a full database dump are stored in one backup zip archive. The recovery is pretty simple: upload the files to the server and import the dump into the database. That's all!<br /><br />The zip process is fast and resource optimized. The script tries to increase all relevant settings to prevent timeouts on big sites. If the hosting company does not provide enough resources or restrict the execution of long processes, then you will probably encounter some problems to create backup files on big sites. In that case you should exclude files or folders which you don't need to backup every time (e.g. images folder) or extend the resources with the help of your hosting company.<br /><br /><strong>System Plugin - Easy Joomla Backup Cronjob</strong><br /><br />With the included plugin you may create backups in the frontend completely automatically. Further information in the description of the plugin!<br /><br />I wish you success and restful nights with the backup component! Please support my work and the free availability of the extension with the purchase of a donation code if it brings an added value to your site.<br /><br />Project page: <a href="_QQ_"http://joomla-extensions.kubik-rubik.de/ejb-easy-joomla-backup"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"EJB - Easy Joomla Backup"_QQ_">EJB - Easy Joomla Backup</a><br /><br />Please write a review in the JED: <a href="_QQ_"http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/access-a-security/site-security/backup/24418"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Easy Joomla Backup in the Joomla!

A comment helps you to find the correct backup if you have a problem and want to go back to an exact state of the website.<br /><br />This component uses the PHP ZipArchive module (php_zip). If this module is not installed, then the component can not create a backup.  Please contact your hosting company if the module is deactivated!<br /><br />If you have a large website, then the creation of the backup archive can take several minutes! Please do not close the window or click anywhere when the backup process is running.<br /><br />The database backup is very important. If you don't change the files on the server, then you should only backup your database. A full backup should always be created before updates of the core or extensions, at least once a week.<br /><br />Easy Joomla Backup creates a ZIP archive with all files and a database dump. If you want to restore the backup, then you have to upload the files to your server and import the SQL dump into your database (e.g. with the help of phpMyAdmin). If you want to restore the backup on another server, then you have to add the new data into the configuration.php manually.</p>"

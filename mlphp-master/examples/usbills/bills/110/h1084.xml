(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 4, 2008. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2008 - (Sec. 4) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President, if in the U.S. national interest, to furnish assistance to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife. Requires specified pre-notification by the President before making assistance available. Limits: (1) program authority to FY2008-FY2010; and (2) annual fiscal year expenditures to $100 million. (Sec. 5) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to establish within the Department of State an Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. Sets forth Office functions. Authorizes the Secretary of State to establish: (1) a Response Readiness Corps (containing an active and standby component consisting of trained U.S. government personnel, including Department and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) employees) to provide stabilization and reconstruction activities in foreign countries or regions that are at risk, in, or are in transition from, conflict or civil strife; and (2) a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps (authorizes such individuals' employment and training). Authorizes FY2007-FY2010 appropriations. Prohibits the establishment and deployment of any Civilian Reserve Corps from substantively impairing state and local capacity and readiness. Directs the Secretary to ensure the use of existing Department and USAID training and education programs.

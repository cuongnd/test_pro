Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2007 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 to extend the award of remaining coral reef conservation program grant funds, in addition to projects addressing emerging priorities or threats, to other appropriate projects, including monitoring and assessment, research, pollution reduction, education, and technical support. Revises the criteria for project approval. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to undertake or authorize actions to minimize injury to a coral reef from vessel impacts, derelict fishing gear, vessel anchors and anchor chains, and unforeseen or disaster-related circumstances and to stabilize, repair, or restore the reef, including vessel removal and emergency restabilization of the vessel or reef. Authorizes any other federal agency to assist, using the other agency's funds. Allows the Administrator to reimburse the other agency. Deems specified terms (such as "sanctuary resources" and "national marine sanctuary"), for purposes of specified provisions of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, to include any coral reef that is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or (subject to state consent) any state, without regard to whether the reef is located in a national marine sanctuary. (Sec. 4) Amends the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 to modify the Act's purposes and to modify the goals and objectives of the national coral reef action strategy. Includes cooperative research and activities designed to minimize the likelihood of physical reef damage in the activities that may be taken under an existing program to conserve coral reefs and reef ecosystems. (Sec. 5) Requires reports to specified congressional committees on all activities to implement the national coral reef action strategy. (Sec. 6) Allows the Coral Reef Conservation Fund to be used to address emergency response actions. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) make community-based planning grants to certain entities that are eligible to receive a coral reef conservation grant to work with local communities and federal and state entities to implement plans for increased protection of high priority coral reefs; (2) maintain an inventory of all vessel grounding incidents involving coral reefs; and (3) identify all coral reefs with a high incidence of vessel impacts and identify measures to reduce such impacts. Establishes the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to coordinate federal actions to preserve and protect coral reef ecosystems. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into multiyear cooperative agreements with agencies and organizations to carry out the activities of the national coral reef action strategy and to implement regional strategies. (Sec. 7) Amends the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to including coral reef ecosystems in the definition of "wildlife" and "wildlife resources." Requires, regarding authorities under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 and the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978, that references to "wildlife" and "fish and wildlife" be construed to include coral reef ecosystems. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide technical assistance and, subject to appropriations, financial assistance to coastal states (as that term is defined in the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000). (Sec. 8) Amends the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 to revise various definitions. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations, through FY2012, for the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, including for community-based planning grants. (Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to conduct activities to improve and promote the resilience of coral reefs and coral reef ecosystems. (Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations: (1) for a research facility for coral reef research and protection, and coastal ecology and development, at the American Samoa Community College; and (2) to provide funds to the University of Guam for coral reef research and protection. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into, renegotiate, or extend a cooperative agreement with any university or local academic institution or other research center with established programs that support coral reef conservation.</summary><link href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1205:"/></bill>

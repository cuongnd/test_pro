Access to Professional Health Insurance Advisors Act of 2011 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to exclude remuneration paid for licensed independent insurance producers from administrative cost calculations for purposes of calculating the medical-loss ratio of a health insurance plan. Defines "independent insurance producer" to mean an insurance agent or broker, insurance consultant, benefit specialist, limited insurance representative, and any other person required to be licensed under the laws of the particular state to sell, solicit, negotiate, service, effect, procure, renew, or bind policies of insurance coverage or offer advice, counsel, opinions, or services related to insurance. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), when a state requests an adjustment of a medical-loss ratio, to defer to the state's findings and determinations as to whether enforcing the required medical-loss ratio may destabilize the individual or small group markets for health insurance.</summary><link href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1206:"/></bill>

Authorizes states to provide additional subsidization, including forgiveness of principal and negative interest loans, to benefit specified municipalities or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology to address water-efficiency goals, address energy-efficiency goals, mitigate stormwater runoff, or encourage environmentally sensitive project planning, design, and construction.
Requires states to: (1) establish affordability criteria to assist in identifying municipalities that would experience a significant hardship raising revenue for fund projects; (2) establish a list of fund projects that prioritizes water quality improvement projects for FY2011 and thereafter; (3) provide financial assistance to only projects on such list; and (4) provide an explanation if they do not fund projects in priority order.

This JavaScript software can record user voice and encode it as MP3 or WAV.

It can start or stop recording the user voice from a microphone or audio source input.

The captured audio can be encoded as :

* BLOB data
* BLOB URL
* Base64 data 

in **MP3** or **WAV** formats.

The encoding is done in the background using worker processes.

This small plugin has the ability to record the user's voice through microphone using the **HTML 5 Audio API**.

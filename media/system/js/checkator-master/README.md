Checkator
==========
Checkator is a jQuery-based replacement for radio and checkbox elements. It supports css styling, and affects the original radio or checkbox element directly, which is used as the data container.
[You can see a demo here](http://opensource.faroemedia.com/checkator).


Usage
-----
###### include in head:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fm.checkator.jquery.css"/>
<script src="jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="fm.checkator.jquery.js"></script>
```

###### to activate replacement:
```javascript
$('.radio_or_checkbox').checkator();
```
If you don't wan't to meddle with scripting, there is an alternative to activate replacement, by using inline markup. 
```html
<input type="checkbox" class="checkator">
```

HTML mangling
-----------
The plugin will wrap the original elements inside divs, and add a div after original element, like shown below:

Before:
```html
<input type="radio" name="radio1" class="radio1" id="radio1_1">
```

After:
```html
<div class="checkator_holder radio">
	<input type="radio" name="radio1" class="radio1 checkator_source" id="radio1_1" style="opacity: 0;">
	<div id="checkator_radio1_1" class="checkator radio"></div>
</div>
```
